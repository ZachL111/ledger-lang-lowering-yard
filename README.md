# ledger-lang-lowering-yard

`ledger-lang-lowering-yard` explores compilers in Julia. The repository keeps the core rule set compact, then surrounds it with examples that show how the decisions move.

## Ledger Lang Lowering Yard Notes

The quickest review path is the verifier first, then the fixtures, then the operations note. That order makes it easy to see whether the code, data, and explanation still agree.

## Why This Exists

This is not a wrapper around a service. It is a self-contained project that shows how the model behaves when demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight move in different directions.

## Feature Notes

- Models source form with deterministic scoring and explicit review decisions.
- Uses fixture data to keep intermediate state changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for bytecode output, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents evaluation checks tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.

## Implementation Notes

The design is intentionally direct: parse or construct a signal, score it, classify it, and verify the expected branch. This makes the repository useful for studying compilers behavior without needing a service or database unless the language project itself is SQL. The Julia project keeps the model in a small module with assertions in a local test script.

## Code Tour

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Local Setup

Use a normal shell with Julia available on `PATH`. The verifier is written as a PowerShell script because the portfolio was assembled on Windows.

## Try It

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Tests

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Example Scenarios

The extended cases are not random smoke tests. `degraded` keeps pressure on the review path, while `surge` shows the model when capacity and weight are strong enough to clear the threshold.

## Boundaries

The scoring model is simple by design. More domain-specific behavior should be added through explicit adapters or extra fixture classes rather than hidden constants.

## Roadmap

- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add one more compilers fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.
